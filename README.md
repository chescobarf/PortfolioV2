# Portfolio v2

For this project, we make use of React Hooks, Router-Dom ‚öõÔ∏è, Tailwind :ocean: and Firebase :fire:

For the deployment of the site, the integration of Netlify üåê with Github :cat: is used, for faster deployments for each commit in our master branch.

## Available scripts

In my case I like to work with separate terminals, so I recommend use in once terminal `npm start` and another `npm run build:css`

### `npm start` :rocket:

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build:css` üé®

With this command it basically serves us for the functionality of **Tailwind**, be aware of the changes in the CSS

### `npm build` :white_check_mark:

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles **React** in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

In addition to this, it **uses PostCSS to minify the CSS** created by Tailwind.

The app is ready to be deployed! :star:
